DISCO:
The print statement in testmod0.py automatically runs when importing the module
Printing app shows the Flask object
Printing request shows the server address where the HTML is hosted
I believe request.args shows the arguments passed to the website, but since no arguments were passed, it printed an empty array []
Printing request.args['username'] causes an error because no username argument was passed to the HTML template
I was able to run the goo function from testmod0 by printing it in the console
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
What does methods = ['GET', 'POST'] in app.route do? Does it matter?
How can I get the other function in testmod0 to print?
How can I avoid importing the file but still let app.py access the contents of testmod0.py? I tried test = testmod0(), but it didnâ€™t work.
