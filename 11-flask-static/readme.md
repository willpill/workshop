# Notes

After running the initial app.py with the route "/", it showed "No hablo queso!" as expected. But after changing the route to "/static/foo.html", it printed out "Is this plaintext, though?" which was what the html in foo.html would print out. When I clicked on the links in foo, it lead me to downloading the foo file. While when I pressed on the foo.html link, it lead the to the site of foo.html. So clicking the link to any specific file will give you that file in a downloaded form or in html.
