# Notes

After running the initial app.py with the route "/", it showed "No hablo queso!" as expected.
But after changing the route to "/static/foo.html", it printed out "Woo"
which was what the html in foo.html would print out. While when I pressed on the foo.html link,
it led to the webpage foo.html. So clicking the link to any specific file
will give you that file in a downloaded or in html page in browser.
